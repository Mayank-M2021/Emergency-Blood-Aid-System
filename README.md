"EMERGENCY BLOOD AID" is a meticulously crafted project designed to facilitate timely blood donations for those in critical need. Developed in C language, it seamlessly integrates with hospital and blood bank databases, enhancing the efficiency of donor matching processes. Robust security measures, including a login feature and password masking using the getch() function, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. File handling techniques, particularly binary files, optimize data storage and retrieval.

Structured around C's powerful features, such as structures and arrays, the project enables comprehensive management of patient and donor information. Key functionalities include adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching records. Patient data capture encompasses vital details like name, age, medical history, and contact information.

A notable innovation within the project is its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, incorporating features for plasma donation management. Leveraging a linked list data structure, the COVID-19 database accommodates dynamic record additions while ensuring efficient plasma donor identification. Automatic updates of donation dates minimize manual intervention, streamlining administrative tasks. Overall, "EMERGENCY BLOOD AID" stands as a testament to the power of technology in alleviating critical healthcare challenges.
